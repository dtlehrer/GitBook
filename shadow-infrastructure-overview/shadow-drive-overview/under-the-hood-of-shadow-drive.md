# Under the hood of Shadow Drive

At the heart of Shadow Drive lives the open source software defined storage program called Ceph.&#x20;

**Ceph was chosen for a number of reasons…**

1. It is VERY open source. Ceph was first presented in 2006 and merged directly into the Linux kernel in 2010. Since then the Ceph GitHub has grown to 179 different repositories. These different repositories have been collectively forked over 10,000 times, had thousands of PRs submitted, and has seen a community of tens of thousands emerge to provide support. [https://github.com/ceph](https://github.com/ceph)
2. It is extremely resilient and adaptable. Ceph is designed to not have a singular point of failure that could lead to data loss. As Shadow Drive is being designed to run in a permissionless trustless decentralized environment, having no singular point of failure is very attractive. The resiliency of how Ceph stores data and its open source design means that Ceph can be forked and modified to be a trustless permissionless decentralized storage layer that can be integrated with smart contracts to protect the stored data against bad actors.
3. Ceph is very performant and scales exceptionally well both horizontally and vertically. Our decentralized cluster consistently handled 2,000 concurrent connections each uploading 10,000 individual objects measuring 2mb in size and sustained an upload speed of 2.7gbps with zero packet loss for extended periods of time. This means that the cluster is so fast that when Solana validators finish block #130188099 we can ingest it, store it, and serve live requests against it **before** block #130188100 is finished and propagated.
4. Ceph’s CRUSH map algorithm is amazing! CRUSH is a scalable pseudorandom data distribution function designed for distributed object-based storage systems that efficiently maps data objects to storage devices without relying on a central directory. The CRUSH whitepaper ([https://ceph.com/assets/pdfs/weil-crush-sc06.pdf](https://ceph.com/assets/pdfs/weil-crush-sc06.pdf)) dives deep into the algorithm but the TL;DR is that CRUSH allows for the decentralization of location for data on an individual byte level. Ceph utilizes CRUSH to literally break stored objects down into component bytes, shards/erasure codes those bytes, and then decentralizes their location in triplicate across any particular Ceph cluster.
5. Speaking of decentralization of data… Ceph runs its own consensus mechanism internally to ensure the integrity of your data. Monitor daemons are the custodians of the pieces of the CRUSH map and are responsible for verifying its accuracy and approving/recording changes to the stored data. Ceph monitors use a Paxos consensus mechanism to maintain a quorum and verify the authenticity of the data stored in the cluster. We will revisit the importance of this consensus mechanism later when we discuss Solana integrations.
6. Finally, Ceph is (hypothetically) infinitely scalable without any notable decreases in performance. There is no hypothetical max to how large a Ceph cluster can become. This is due to the different software daemons Ceph employs and how well the CRUSH algorithm scales. The largest Ceph cluster ever tested successfully stored 10,000,000,000 unique objects. If we think about each Solana block produced we are currently in the 120millions (as of the time of this writing). Therefore, Ceph is uniquely positioned to be the best possible solution for a blockchain that produces a new block every 400 milliseconds.

…the creator of the Paxos Consensus Mechansim, Leslie Lamport, is also honored as Solana’s biggest technical influences…

### If nothing else… <a href="#b15e" id="b15e"></a>

It’s kinda cool to know that we’re using the same DB software as the CERN team is! [https://indico.cern.ch/event/649159/contributions/2761965/attachments/1544385/2423339/hroussea-storage-at-CERN.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/649159/contributions/2761965/attachments/1544385/2423339/hroussea-storage-at-CERN.pdf)&#x20;

In fact, the CERN team submitted PR's to the main Ceph branch to have their home grown improvements included in the main branch.

Of course, none of this is to suggest that Ceph is some kind of a perfect solution that has no flaws and can do no wrong. However, for our use case Ceph checks all boxes of performance, reliability, durability, scalability, and its functionality can be adapted to provide the decentralized trustless data storage that Solana needs.
